# javascript and classes

## OOP

## object
- collection of properties and methods
- toLowerCase

## parts of OOP
Object literal

- Constructor function
- Prototypes
- Classes
- Instances (new, this) 

## 4 pillars
Abstraction
Encapsulation
Inheritance
Polymorphism

Encapsulation:

Definition: Encapsulation is the bundling of data (attributes) and the methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit, known as a class. It involves restricting access to some of an object's components and only exposing what is necessary.
Purpose: Encapsulation helps in organizing and protecting the internal state of an object. It allows for the implementation details to be hidden from the outside world, promoting a clear separation between an object's internal workings and its external interface.

Inheritance:

Definition: Inheritance is a mechanism that allows a new class (subclass or derived class) to inherit properties and behaviors (attributes and methods) from an existing class (base class or parent class). The new class can extend or override the functionality of the existing class.
Purpose: Inheritance promotes code reuse and establishes a relationship between classes. It enables the creation of a hierarchy of classes, where common characteristics are defined in a superclass, and specific features are added or modified in subclasses.

Polymorphism:

Definition: Polymorphism means "many forms." It allows objects of different types to be treated as objects of a common type. There are two types of polymorphism: compile-time (method overloading) and runtime (method overriding).
Purpose: Polymorphism simplifies code and enhances flexibility. It enables a single interface to be used for various data types, allowing for more generic and reusable code. Runtime polymorphism allows different objects to respond to the same method call in their own unique way.

Abstraction:

Definition: Abstraction is the process of simplifying complex systems by modeling classes based on the essential properties and behaviors they share. It involves hiding unnecessary details while emphasizing the essential features of an object.
Purpose: Abstraction reduces complexity by focusing on the relevant aspects of an object. It helps in creating a conceptual model that is easier to understand and work with. Abstraction allows programmers to deal with high-level ideas without getting bogged down by low-level details.
